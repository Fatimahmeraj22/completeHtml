<h3>paragraph</h3>
<p>To create a paragraph, surround
    the words that make up the
    paragraph with an opening
    tag and closing </p>
    

<h3>Bold & Italic</h3>
    <b>
        By enclosing words in the tags
        <b> and </b> we can make
        characters appear bold.
        The <b> element also represents
        a section of text that would be
        presented in a visually different
        way (for example key words in a
        paragraph) although the use of
        the <b> element does not imply
        any additional meaning

        <i>
            By enclosing words in the tags
            <i> and </i> we can make
            characters appear italic.
            The <i> element also represents
            a section of text that would be
            said in a different way from
            surrounding content — such as
            technical terms, names of ships,
            foreign words, thoughts, or other
            terms that would usually be
            italicized.
            
            <br>

            <h3>Horizontal lines</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>To create a break between
                themes — such as a change of
                topic in a book or a new scene
                in a play — you can add a
                horizontal rule between sections
                using the <hr /> tag</p>


                <h3>Strong & Emphasis</h3>
                <strong>
                    The use of the <strong>
                    element indicates that its
                    content has strong importance.
                    For example, the words
                    contained in this element might
                    be said with strong emphasis.
                    By default, browsers will show
                    the contents of a <strong>
                    element in bold.

                    <p><strong>Beware:</strong> Pickpockets operate in
                        this area.</p>
                       <p>This toy has many small pieces and is <strong>not
                        suitable for children under five years old.
                       </strong></p>


                       <em>
                        The <em> element indicates
                        emphasis that subtly changes
                        the meaning of a sentence.
                        By default browsers will show
                        the contents of an <em> element
                        in italic


                        <p>I <em>think</em> Ivy was the first.</p>
<p>I think <em>Ivy</em> was the first.</p>
<p>I think Ivy was the <em>first</em>.</p>
